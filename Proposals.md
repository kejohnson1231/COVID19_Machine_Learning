# Proposal 1 - Create a dataset and use it to study how certain factors are affecting COVID19 infection/death rates

### High Level Description

My goal for this project is to create a data set sourced from multiple websites. The data set will contain county by county information for COVID19 cases and COVID 19 deaths. It will also contain socio/economic data by county, and information about when the stay at home orders were announce and enforced. 


### Approach

First I will have to use scraping, APIs, githubs, to create a dataset that can be analyzed. I plan to initally explore the various features and how they interact with the number of cases, the number of cases per capita, and the death rate (number of deaths/number of cases). 

For analysis I plan to start with random forest, as that tends to work the best out of the box. I do also plan to verify that there isn't a better model for fitting the data intially. 

Once I have a baseline score, I plan to tune my model and attempt to maximize accuracy without overfitting. 

I hope to present my work in either a clean notebook or slides.
